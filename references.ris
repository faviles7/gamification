AB  - Taking a process-orientated, social constructivist lens, we examine the case of a digital game called Words Matter. The game was designed for children with dyslexia and was informed by principles from casual games and evidence-based practice from special education. Focusing on the game play of two groups of children, we employ a systematic thematic analytic approach on videos of children's verbal and non-verbal interaction triangulated with their game logs, concentrating on the nature of student-student as well as student-tutor social interactions. Our findings show that children spontaneously engage in ‘game talk’ regarding game performance, content, actions and experiences. While this game talk facilitates a strong sense of social engagement and playfulness, it also caters to a variety of new opportunities for learning by sparking tutor and student-initiated interventions. Alongside its social theoretical lens on digital games-based learning, the paper analyses game-based social interactions in tandem with game design decisions enabling additional implications to be drawn for pedagogical practice and game design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The concept of gamification is receiving increasing attention, particularly for its potential to motivate students. However, to date the majority of studies in the context of education have predominantly focused on University students. This paper explores how gamification could potentially benefit a specific student population, children with dyslexia who are transitioning from primary to secondary school. Two teachers from specialist dyslexia teaching centres used classDojo, a gamification platform, during their teaching sessions for one term. We detail how the teachers appropriated the platform in different ways and how the students discussed classDojo in terms of motivation. These findings have subsequently informed a set of provisional implications for gamification distilling opportunities for future pedagogical uses, gamification design for special education and methodological approaches to how gamification is studied.

AB  - The design of a serious game depends on number of factors, including collaboration between different actors, context of use, user profile, and game mechanics. This article presents a methodology for the design of serious games for children with hearing impairments, using a Human Interaction Computer (HCI) approach. The proposed methodology has been applied in a study case for children with hearing impairments in the USAER program in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the experience of children using the ABC-Spanish game in literacy learning is evaluated. The results obtained on evaluating user experience help o identify aspects in the game mechanics, such as the most appropriate device, continuous feedback, challenges, scoring system, and learning levels. Based on an analysis of requirements, user needs are identified in an educational context incorporating a learning style called Fitzgerald Keys. A heuristics set forms a validation model that allows the level of accomplishment of pedagogical objectives of the prototype game to be assessed. The results are positive. The questionnaire responses produced a high score of 80% indicating success in identifying features to be improved and integrated in the methodology. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Learning to read is very challenging for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but also very important, as it can give them access to new knowledge. This is even more challenging in minimally verbal children, who do not have the verbal abilities to learn through usual methods. To address the learning of literacy skills in French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD, we designed the serious game SEMA-TIC, which relies on non-verbal cognitive skills and uses specific learning strategies adapted to the features of autistic individuals. This study investigated the usability of SEMA-TIC (in terms of adaptability, efficiency, and effectiveness) for the acquisition of literacy skills in French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD. Twenty-five children with ASD and no functional language participated in the study. Children in the training group received the SEMA-TIC training over 23 weeks (on average), while no intervention was provided to children in the non-training group. Results indicated that SEMA-TIC presents a suitable usability, as all participants were able to play (adaptability), to complete the training (efficiency) and to acquire significant literacy skills (effectiveness). Indeed, the literacy skills in the training group significantly improved after the training, as measured by specific experimental tasks (alphabet knowledge, word reading, word-non-word discrimination, sentence reading and word segmentation; all p ≤ 0.001) compared to the non-training group. More importantly, 3 out of 12 children of the training group could be considered as word decoders at the end of the intervention, whereas no children of the non-training group became able to decode words efficiently. The present study thus brings preliminary evidence that French minimally verbal school-aged children with ASD are able to learn literacy skills through SEMA-TIC, a specific computerized intervention consisting in a serious game based on non-verbal cognitive skills. © 2017 Serret, Hun, Thümmler, Pierron, Santos, Bourgeois and Askenazy.

AB  - In present and future society, all individuals must be able to face the problems, risks, advantages and opportunities that will arrive with new paradigms in the labour market, social relations and technology. To reach this goal, a quality and inclusive education together with a proper and complete formation in technology (communications, robotics, programming, computational thinking (CT), etc.) must be imparted at all educational levels. Moreover, all individuals should have the same opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, as stated in Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainable Education. Following this trend, in the present work, a practical experience about how to teach CT using robotics is developed, showing the results and evaluation of the lessons on robotics taught to students in their 4th year of compulsory secondary education, and where the students showed a high degree of apathy and demotivation. The teaching unit was based on an action research approach that includes a careful selection of pedagogical techniques and instruments to attract and keep the attention and interest of the students. In addition to the robotics lessons, a previous computational thinking training with Blockly Games was carried out, which contributed to noticeably increase the students motivation and to introduce them to the programming of robots. Moreover, gamification was used to motivate and evaluate the individual knowledge, and the students were required to present the work performed through a final project. The individual needs of the students were fulfilled with a daily monitoring. The results show that the pedagogical techniques, instruments and evaluation were adequate to increase the motivation of the students and to obtain a significant learning, showing how the teaching of CT may attract students that have lost interest and motivation, while providing them with abilities that will be essential for the learning throughout life. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Numerous studies highlight that serious games, 3D virtual learning environments and Information Communication Technologies can be powerful tools in supporting people affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders. In particular, they can be very effective in helping to recognize and comprehend social behaviours and emotions. In this paper, an authoring system designed and implemented in order to stimulate and to facilitate the understanding of emotions is presented (Face 3D). This software could be a highly appropriate tool for autistic children with high cognitive functions, who are often attracted by technology. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Students with Intellectual Disability (ID) are often described as "slow learners" and cannot easily integrate to the normal curriculum. Still, the needs of a person with ID for accomplishment, enjoyment and perception of high quality multimedia content are augmented. In general education settings digital games for learning seem to work successfully with students, regardless of their developmental state or academic achievements. However, can such an approach work in a suitable and effective way for students with ID? If the answer to this question is positive, under which conditions and limitations can digital games be integrated into the ID instructional process? The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the common grounds between methodologies for Special Education Needs/Intellectual Disability (SEN/ID) pedagogy on the one hand and Digital Games-Based Learning (DGBL) on the other, as well as to explore the potential of using digital games for SEN/ID students. To this end, the usage of digital games in the learning experience of students with Intellectual Disability is discussed, the ways in which commercial and educational games support various SEN methodologies and theories regarding Intellectual Disability pedagogy are examined and findings from the education literature as well as experimental observations and case studies are presented in order to investigate how and to what extent learning-purposed as well as entertainment-purposed games are able to constitute a powerful educational medium for SEN education and its inclusive objectives. © 2009, IGI Global.

AB  - As the number of people suffering from visual impairments continuously increases, there is strong need for efficient sensory substitution devices, that can support creating a rich mental spatial depiction of the environment. The use of the auditory sense has proved to be an effective approach towards creating a method of interaction with the elements of the surrounding space in a way which resembles the natural 3D visual representation of normal sighted people. Training is an essential component in the process of employing an auditory-based visual substitution device for blind people, as it helps them to learn and become proficient to process and decode the audio information and convert it into spatial mental representation. Taking into account the well-known advantages of game based learning, we propose a new method of training, consisting in a navigational 3D audio-based game. In this exploratory, goal-directed application, the player has to perform route-navigational tasks under different conditions, with the purpose of training and testing their orientation and mobility skills, relying exclusively on the perception of 3D audio cues. Experimental results showed that this game-based learning strategy leads to substantial improvements and can be a starting point for developing more enhanced sound-based navigational applications. The ludic-oriented, motivational training approach achieved straightforward immersion and concentration on the cognitive depiction of the environment, ensuring behavioral gains in the sound-directed spatial orientation. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The Routledge Companion to Music, Technology, and Education is a comprehensive resource that draws together burgeoning research on the use of technology in music education around the world. Rather than following a procedural how-to approach, this companion considers technology, musicianship, and pedagogy from a philosophical, theoretical, and empirically-driven perspective, offering an essential overview of current scholarship while providing support for future research. The 37 chapters in this volume consider the major aspects of the use of technology in music education: Part I. Contexts. Examines the historical and philosophical contexts of technology in music. This section addresses themes such as special education, cognition, experimentation, audience engagement, gender, and information and communication technologies. Part II. Real Worlds. Discusses real world scenarios that relate to music, technology, and education. Topics such as computers, composition, performance, and the curriculum are covered here. Part III. Virtual Worlds. Explores the virtual world of learning through our understanding of media, video games, and online collaboration. Part IV. Developing and Supporting Musicianship. Highlights the framework for providing support and development for teachers, using technology to understand and develop musical understanding. The Routledge Companion to Music, Technology, and Education will appeal to undergraduate and post-graduate students, music educators, teacher training specialists, and music education researchers. It serves as an ideal introduction to the issues surrounding technology in music education. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Digital game making is becoming an increasingly common means of learning in schools due to the appeal of delivering curriculum-based learning objectives while tapping into the popularity of videogames. Indeed, research suggests that digital game making may improve cognitive and behavioral skills in learners and this may have significant impact on learners with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). However, past work in digital game making has limited involvement with learners with SEND, focuses on short-term evaluations and is utilised during extra-curricular sessions with few studies using an action-based field research approach. Furthermore, there is little quantitative data from defined methodologies that demonstrate the impact of digital game-making on learning. This paper presents results from two field trials examining the use of digital game making in two schools (one mixed ability primary and one special school) to deliver national curriculum-based content over 8-weeks. Results from a feasibility trial informed a pedagogical design and identified evaluation metrics for a subsequent longer trial. Evaluation metrics included learner engagement and collaboration with peers as suitable indicators of inclusive learning. Impact on these metrics was measured using an in-class observation tool that sampled learner behavior yielding quantitative data and follow up interviews with teachers yielding qualitative data. Results suggest that digital game making is at least as effective in encouraging engagement and collaboration in learners when compared to traditional methods, with it being more engaging for learners with special needs. Contributions from this paper provide quantifiable evidence for the perceived benefits of using digital game making and a methodology for evaluating engagement and collaboration through classroom observation. Recommendations for further work and refinements of the pedagogical implementation that builds on these findings are presented. © 2020

AB  - In a globalized and interconnected world where societies are close to continuous changes and demanding functional, active and efficient learning. Now more than ever, education is configured as a primary element to develop, on the one hand and instrumental techniques of each of the knowledge areas notions and on the other, the skills that enable a person to function in these scenarios alternatives, where communication and socialization are key tools. However, taking into consideration that effective learning considers various psychological processes such as attention, memory, perception, motivation, emotion; but also relies on a series of educational psychology and instructional principles as imitation, interest, activity, significance or play. Indeed, the latter is a pedagogical tool in classrooms employees, in all its variants, for the conquest of the various learning as internal attributes it own. The following article presents theoretical lines one alternative of this educational principle, videogames, thinking about their properties and the benefits that involve in developing inclusive learning processes, where the elements of presence, participation and achievement is demonstrated. © 2015 Digital Education Review.

AB  - Given the increasingly aging population, nearly every doctor will encounter elderly adults who present with multiple complex comorbidities that can challenge even experienced physicians. This may explain why many medical students do not have a positive attitude toward elderly adults and find the complexity of their problems overwhelming. It was hypothesized that a recently developed medical school geriatrics course, based on the game GeriatriX and designed specifically to address the complexities associated with decision-making in geriatrics, can have a positive effect on attitudes toward geriatrics and on perceived knowledge of geriatrics. The effects of this game-based course were evaluated as a proof of concept. The assessment was based on the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD) and a validated self-perceived knowledge scale of geriatric topics. The usability of (and satisfaction with) GeriatriX was also assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. After completion of the course, the ASD changed significantly in the geriatrics course group (n = 29; P =.02) but not in a control group that took a neuroscience course (n = 24; P =.30). Moreover, the geriatrics course group had a significant increase in self-perceived knowledge for 12 of the 18 topics (P =.002), whereas in the control group self-perceived knowledge increased significantly for one topic only (sensory impairment) (P =.04). Finally, the geriatrics students reported enjoying GeriatriX. This proof-of-concept study clearly supports the hypothesis that a 4-week course using a modern educational approach such as GeriatriX can improve students' self-perceived knowledge of geriatrics and their attitudes toward elderly adults. © 2014, The American Geriatrics Society.

AB  - This paper explains why and how video games can motivate students to learn. It explains key concepts linked to motivation, engagement and flow, and illustrates how some features in video games can promote intrinsic motivation, hence encourage and sustain learning. In the second part of the paper, empirical evidence of the motivational aspects of video games is presented, with reference to recent scientific studies conducted essentially between 2005 and 2011. Evidence collected demonstrates that games are employed to increase learners' motivation, in a wide range of settings, for different topics (e.g., science, literature, or engineering), and to address the different needs and specificities of learners (e.g., gender, age, or special needs). It also shows that games can teach both academic and non-academic skills, and motivate students to collaborate, share information, and increase their attainments, and that, in many cases, they are more effective than traditional approaches. These results emphasize that some additional mechanisms need to be implemented in games to ensure that they systematically manage to engage, teach and change students' behaviors. These include game design (e.g., personalized strategies, adapted challenge or a good balance between educational and entertaining features), and teaching strategies (e.g., briefing, debriefing, and teachers' support).

AB  - Attention plays an important role in the daily lives of people and especially in learning. It may be influenced by different factors since childhood or during the aging process because of deficits such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is responsible of learning difficulties. Serious games for attention training may be helpful to develop self-regulation skills in attention training through a personalized game experience. It can provide children with appropriate guidance to develop their self-regulation skills while enhancing their cognitive functions such as attention. The transparency of the user model may help users (both children and tutors) to follow their progression, and to develop their learning strategy. In this paper, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the assessment step of a developed attention training serious game. The objective was to study whetherthe transparency ofthelearner model influences the users' perception of their attention and self-regulate their learning. The primary results of the pilot experiment show that open learner model influences the decision of users on difficulty levelpreference that may be promising in self-regulated attention training. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In 2019, the mobile learning body of knowledge is extensive and much is known about the technology impacts and affordances of mobile devices in educational settings. A particular focus has now shifted toward specific technologies in specific subjects. Mathematics is one such subject and tablets are one such technology that is gaining attention. This systematic review representing the latest generation of tablet technology within the tablet-mediated learning in mathematics body of knowledge sought to derive evidence that supported questions into (a) what math sub-disciplines were covered, (b) what technology (application/hardware) was utilized, and (c) what pedagogical approaches were deployed in educational settings. This included analysis of the (d) advantages and (e) disadvantages present in those elements. Thirty-nine relevant articles were collected from various academic technology and educational databases. The results demonstrate that tablets are being predominantly deployed in various sub-disciplines such as Arithmetic, Computation, and Geometry with the iPad as the dominant choice for tablet hardware/applications. Pedagogical approaches lean heavily on game-based learning, environment interaction, and special needs support. Technological advantages include increased collaboration and mathematics engagement enabled by tablet mobility and a high potential for customization of solutions. Developers, teachers, and researchers need to be informed of potential challenges in designing content for tablet technology deployments in mathematics. © 2019 International Association of Online Engineering.

AB  - Educational games have been shown to provide support for children with learning disabilities to overcome their challenges. Gaming and feedback elements can benefit the learning process while keeping children engaged and help them to regain motivation for learning. We present the design of a mobile serious game for German dyslexic primary school children that incorporates gaming elements such as narrative, pedagogical agents, tutorials, feedback, and reward mechanisms. We derive our game design decisions and specify the rationales behind with special focus on the needs and demands of the target group. We evaluate the gaming elements based on the results of 63 children who played the game at home during a period of 9–10 weeks. Results indicate overall positive perception of the game elements. Children were immersed in the fantasy-themed world, liked the pedagogical agents, and indicated that the interactive tutorials gave an easy start into the game, and emphasized the special importance of praise. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Objective: To investigate if 3D gamified simulations can be valid vocational training tools for persons with intellectual disability. Methods: A 3D gamified simulation composed by a set of training tasks for cleaning in hostelry was developed in collaboration with professionals of a real hostel and pedagogues of a special needs school. The learning objectives focus on the acquisition of vocabulary skills, work procedures, social abilities and risk prevention. Several accessibility features were developed to make the tasks easy to do from a technological point-of-view. A pilot experiment was conducted to test the pedagogical efficacy of this tool on intellectually disabled workers and students. Results: User scores in the gamified simulation follow a curve of increasing progression. When confronted with reality, they recognized the scenario and tried to reproduce what they had learned in the simulation. Finally, they were interested in the tool, they showed a strong feeling of immersion and engagement, and they reported having fun. Conclusions: On the basis of this experiment we believe that 3D gamified simulations can be efficient tools to train social and professional skills of persons with intellectual disabilities contributing thus to foster their social inclusion through work. © Schattauer 2017.

AB  - Appropriation of e-learning applications in the class mainly depends on three actors: developers, teachers (experts interested in authoring or using applications), and learners (pupils or students who will play to learn or to express their knowledge). This paper addresses the problems facing primary and secondary school teachers in the technologyenhanced classroom. First we identify three teachers' attitudes towards learning games and apps in the classroom. These attitudes determine how the teacher will contextualize the chosen technologies in the individual (teachers' own appropriation of technologies), interpersonal (interaction and activities in class-guided participation) and community plane (school system and pedagogical goal-apprenticeship). This contribution is based on studies conducted in different Danish schools in the past two years, including primary and secondary education, and classes with special needs students. Our second contribution results from a broad survey of learning applications and game authoring environment for nonprogrammers, which provided a classification and allowed us to explicit the roles of different actors in the technologyaugmented classroom. We adopt an inclusive perspective on the design of e-learning solutions, based on Rogoff three planes of analysis. The insights from our 2 contributions lead to a tripartite architecture for the creation, sharing and managing of learning games, supporting three actors, and an early prototype of a CMS, currently under development. © The Authors, 2016.

AB  - Children with learning disabilities need dedicated attention to cope with their peers in class. One way to help is using technological assistive learning means as an extra gate to learn different concepts. This study describes the findings of comparative experimental research that questions the effect of using serious games on these children’s learning process. The main focus is the design, implementation, and evaluation of an educational platform with different games that are picked based on existing special teaching strategies. It is created to question whether serious games can facilitate the work of the professionals or not by comparing it with a normal instructional method, in the context of an educational activity, which is learning the Arabic alphabet. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies - including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires - provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In this article, we will describe the embedded case study of the European project “E-Magic” carried out within the Erasmus+ project and which involved 12-16 years old students and teachers from three nations: “Acharnes Special Education Vocational School” in Athens (Greece), IIS “L. Da VinciNitti”, a high school in Potenza (Italy), and from Gabinete de Modernizao das Tecnologias Educativas (G.M.T.E.) in Madeira Islands (Portugal). The project is finalized to enhance Mathematical Competencies by Serious Games learning. We carried out both empirical qualitative and quantitative methods to highlight Serious Games’ effectiveness, as a teaching methodology, in motivating students to learn mathematics. We also hypothesize that prompting a strategic way of thinking within a didactical intervention by game-approach could improve students’ proving processes and support them in mathematical thinking production. Rabardel’s cognitive ergonomics and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge model are the lenses for reading educational experiments’ data. Data seems to show that simulation helps students find alternative and creative solutions to problems. Therefore, Serious Games’ use in education promotes significant changes and mental resources activation. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - This paper presents the ontological design and implementation of the differentiated learning environment in the domain model of an intelligent tutoring system for children with specific learning disabilities. It addresses the learners need for differentiated instruction in a preferential learning environment. The proposed model helps to identify the most affected learning domains and related multiple-criteria’s which effects the learners. The learning resources and problems diagnosis questionnaires are organized and used with various learning strategies to create various learning environments such as case-based learning environment, game-based learning environment, practice-based learning environment and visual-based learning environment. Different techniques can define a set of rules to decide the most preferred learning environment. Here, multiple criteria decision analysis approach map the information, learning resources and learning environments to create a differentiated learning environment for the learning disabled. The contribution of proposed model is to reduce the gap between learner and learning habits with special needs. Our model is implemented as domain model of an intelligent tutoring system to develop learner-centric learning environment. In the designed intelligent tutoring system (ITS), the differentiated learning environment domain model is further evaluated and validated by a set of fuzzy rules. The pilot test result shows that proposed model enables an ITS to improve the implementation of appropriate learning strategies with high accuracy and sensitivity for both learning and non-learning-disabled users. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many research studies agree on the existence of a close link between emotion and cognition. Actually, much research has demonstrated that students with learning disabilities (LD) experience emotional distress related to their difficulties. In this regard, this article proposes a new methodology of designing intelligent games called KASP Methodology, it's a new approach applied to the serious games (SGs) design field. It includes new decisive factors for designing SGs for children with LD. The proposed methodology is based on four pillars which are: Knowledge, Affect, Sensory and Pedagogy and it aims helping designers of serious games for building suitable serious learning games for children with LD taking into account the cognitive and emotional aspects of the child learner in order to improve his learning rhythm and foster his emotional state related to learning in a playful and interactive environment. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

AB  - Children diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as one of the most complex neurodevelopmental disabilities, are characterized by different brain and functioning development, distinct interaction with the environment and different learning patterns, language and social skills impairments, and repetitive auto-stimulating restricting behaviors. It has been shown that computer-assisted intervention is much more attention captivating and interesting to children compared with a classic approach to teaching, allowing for faster acquisition of skills. This makes these tools and the technology highly suitable for teaching children with autism basic developmental skills. In addition, interactive electronic books showed positive outcomes for comprehension and information acquisition in children with ASD, while decreasing inappropriate children behavior in the classroom. In this paper a pilot user study on an e-book with an embedded educational game for children with developmental disorders was presented. The results show that the e-book can be efficiently used for teaching children with ASD basic developmental skills and that the learned skills can be efficiently transfered to new media and environments. The framework will provide preschool children with and without disabilities with appropriate educational software, to build up their early cognitive abilities and school readiness skills, and promote incorporating technology as part of the educational and pedagogical process in schools. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine similarites and differences between motion-based video games (MBVGs) and “real-life” wall/rock climbing and determine the perceived usefulness of utilizing MBVGs when trying to teach someone how to authentically wall/rock climb. A mixed-methods multi-phase intervention with two randomized groups–wall/rock climbing first (WF; n = 12) and MBVGs first (GF; n = 12) utilizing Xbox One’s Kinect Sports Rivals Rock Climbing–was used. All participants had no prior climbing experience. Results indicated the participants perceived MBVGs and authentic wall/rock climbing were similar concerning climbing tactics/strategies and arm movements, but were different regarding effort and leg, finger/grip, and jumping movements. Moreover, both the MBVGs and “real-life” wall/rock climbing experiences were needed for a significant difference in the participants’ perceived understanding of both the necessary motor skills and tactics/strategies needed to wall/rock climb. In sum, MBVGs may be used as a pedagogical tool to teach strategies of wall/rock climbing, particularly with beginners or those with special needs, but caution must be heeded due to perceived effort and lower extremity movement differences compared to authentic climbing. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In conventional classroom driven instructor training, disabled student achieved low personality & motivation, more mental load due to lack of practical learning and unsuitable usage of learning material through different simulated contexts. Therefore, intent of proposed study is to integrate microworld game-based learning to different learning styles of special needs students which enhance their learning performance and encourage them to discover and solve problems they faced during classroom teaching. A quasi experimental design was implemented in the proposed SmartLearn system in natural science behavioral course to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results showed that students who adopted microworld gaming-based system was able to reduce their cognitive load, enhance learning motivation skills to gain understanding on novel concepts, improve personality to foster interpersonal skills, self-efficacy and improvements in learning achievements in comparison to the conventional learning technology driven approach. The findings of this study provide good evidence for special needs children where association of practically applied learning scenarios with gaming contexts improve their performance which encourages development of such systems for learners suffered from Autism, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia.

AB  - With the growth in popularity of video games in our society many teachers have worked to incorporate gaming into their classroom. It is generally agreed that by adding something fun to the learning process students become more engaged and, consequently, retain more knowledge. However, although the characteristics of video games facilitate the dynamics of the educational process it is necessary to plan a pedagogical project that includes delimitation of learning goals and profile of the addressees, the conditions of application of the educational project, and the methodologies of evaluation of the learning progress. This is how we can make a real difference between gamification and video game based learning. The paper addresses the design of an educational resource for special education needs (SEN) students that aims to help teach communicative skills related to prosody. The technological choices made to support the pedagogic issues that underlie the educational product, the strategies to convert learning content into playful material, and the methodology to obtain measures of its playability and effectiveness are described. The results of the motivation test certified that the video game is useful in encouraging the users to exercise their voice and the indicators of the degree of achievement of the learning goals serve to identify the most affected prosodic skills. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Autism spectrum is a disorder that offers a lot of difficulties and challenges to people with it and related to. As for the learning process of these children, it is known that the use of consistent repetitions helps in the learning of people with autism and, in addition, that combinations of images with words are one of the main means of aid in learning for autistic people. Augmented Reality (AR) is a digital resource that acts as a way of visualizing virtual elements, often three-dimensional (3D), together with the real environment. AR offers enormous educational potential when used in conjunction with gamification. This work aims to implement a gamified project using augmented reality to assist in the learning process of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The project was implemented in Cri.Ativa, the psycho-pedagogical care room of a child development center that provides multidisciplinary care for children with atypical development (especially for children on the autism spectrum) in Palmas, Brazil. In general, it is considered that the objective of the work was achieved because the desired process was gamified and the results obtained by its implementation were positive. However, it is important to highlight that, due to the huge number of possible characteristics for children with ASD, this result does not demonstrate that the application of the described process will have equally positive outcomes in all contexts. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This paper attempts to raise a discussion regarding video game consoles which integrate motion sensor technologies, by examining their exploitation within educational context. There are several motion sensing technologies, but only three of them stand out, based on their market share. These are: a) Nintendo Wii, b) Microsoft Kinect, and c) Sony PlayStation Move. The Nintendo Wii was created and developed by Nintendo Company. The main controller is the Wii remote, a handheld device which can be utilized as a gesture recognition and pointing tool. Kinect is a motion sensing input device, implemented by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 game console. The device provides a natural user interface that allows users to interact without any intermediary device. PlayStation Move is a motion-sensing game controller platform by Sony Computer Entertainment, first released for the Play Station 3 game console. Based on a handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses a PlayStation Eye camera to track the wand's position, and inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. This paper will present an overview of the existing literature, while attempting to categorize the educational approaches which involve motion sensor technologies. This categorization will consist of two parts. The first one will concern the education of people with special needs, under which many research approaches can be found. The utilization of motion sensor technologies, incorporated by the three most common game consoles, in the education of people with special needs will be examined. The second one will refer to various educational approaches in regular education, under which not so many research approaches, but many teaching ideas can be found. The aim of the paper is to serve as a reference point for every individual/group, willing to explore the sensor-based Games Based Learning (SBGBL) research area, by providing a complete and structured literature review.

AB  - Background: One of the most serious concerns of parents, caregivers, teachers and therapists is children's independent living, particularly of those with special educational needs (SEN). Purpose-built programs for the acquisition of independent living skills are considered a priority in special education settings. The main problem is the inefficacy of detached interventions to meet the needs of as many students as possible. Objective: Our response is to create transmedia applications for inclusive learning environments. To this end, we have taken a participatory design approach to develop a project for Daily Living Skills Training by combining special education pedagogies, filmic methods, game design and innovative technologies. In this paper, we present the design and development of Waking up In the Morning (WUIM), and its improvement through user-based and expert-based evaluations by students, therapists and developers. The main research purpose is to confirm if: (1) the final products of the WUIM project could be educational resources for students with SEN and (2) the common gaming experience could promote collaborative learning, regardless of students' cognitive profile. Methods: During the alpha phase, we developed and improved WUIM. In July 2020, we implemented and evaluated WUIM in special education settings (beta-phase). More specifically, a quantitative and qualitative formative evaluation was conducted with children who have developmental disabilities (N= 11), their therapists (N= 7) and developers (N= 2). Methods of data collection included questionnaires filled in by therapists and developers, participant observation by researchers and interviews with children. Results: The results of the formative evaluation were generally positive regarding four-factor groups that shape the learning experience: Content, Technical characteristics, User state of mind, Characteristics that allow learning. After the design team reviewed the potential users and experts' comments that were mainly related to the user interface, the application was improved. Conclusions: The two hypotheses have been largely confirmed. Overall, we propose a simplified development process that showcases the importance of arts-based methods and aesthetics which deliver representational fidelity. The study reveals the necessity of developing transmedia learning materials to meet each individual's needs. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Research has demonstrated that videogame programs can be an effective intervention targeting social challenges among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the rapid growth in developing videogame programs, incorporation of stakeholders' views has been limited. Objective: This project aimed to identify the design elements that should be considered during development of videogame programs for children with ASD, from the perspectives of stakeholders. Materials and Methods: We involved 26 stakeholders, including parents of children with ASD, youth with ASD, and clinicians working with individuals with ASD in focus groups and interviews. Results: Thematic analysis yielded three themes: (1) addressing heterogeneity and diverse needs; (2) mirroring real world; and (3) teaching strategies. Conclusion: Incorporating these elements during development of videogame programs can help enhance the outcomes for children with ASD. By including stakeholders' voices, it is assumed that the developed videogame programs may serve as user-friendly and engaging tools to potentially complement traditional interventions when overcoming social difficulties in individuals with ASD. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - The article focuses on the evaluation procedure that accompanies the educational video game Pradia: mystery in the city. The video game is designed as an educational support tool that aims to improve the prosodic and communication skills of people with Down Syndrome, but to be effective it must be accompanied by a method of data export and evaluation of the results. To do this, the Test of Prosodic Skills of PRADIA (THAP-PRADIA) analyzes the degree of success in each of the activities included in the game and offers scores that estimate the learning progress. The exportation of the data and its latest analysis allow to obtain reports of results with different levels of detail: the scores can be grouped according to the learning objectives pursued by the video game, or a report can be extracted for each of the dynamics of the game. The organization of the results from the most general to the more particular allows us to obtain a global assessment of the communicative performance and the prosodic skills of the user throughout the game time, and at the same time to observe the most significant shortcomings, with the goal of proposing new teaching strategies. © Universidad de Murcia 2018.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of mobile applications is gaining popularity among people, spreading to different areas. Specifically, the use of mobile applications has boomed in the field of education, with the increasing variety of applications in the application stores (PlayStore, AppStore, etc) that address specific problems of stories becoming increasingly common in the market like: problems of reading, writing, mathematics and other topics. On the other hand, the special education is an area of attention to children with special educational needs such as attention deficit, intellectual disability, speech problems, among other problems. Specifically, children who have problems in literacy with special educational need, face a challenge during their learning process of reading and writing. Because of this, special education has begun to incorporate the use of technology through the use of mobile applications in the classroom. In this context, we believe that teaching strategies can be adapted to the development of competences, both specific and transversal, in special education students, while at the same time they can increase students motivation during their learning process. These elements are known as gamification techniques. There is a seies of gamification techniques that can be incorporated into the learning process in children with special educational needs. The present work exposes the gamification techniques incorporated in a playful way in mobile applications, as well as a methodological proposal for the integration of these techniques in special education enviroments, making a case study in conjunction with teachers and special education children. First section of the article consits of a brief introduction to the reader on the subject of the gamification techniques, in wich they are found and some examples of gamification techniques used. Section II exposes the problem that can be solved in this work, section III presents the methodology used for the preparation of this work, describing each of the stages by wich it is composed. Section IV presents the case study that was conducted in conjuntion with special education children and finally section V discusss the results and conclusions that wre obtained from the work done. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an approach regarding the use of a serious game with a playware object to improve the development of emotional skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The playware object is an interactive way for the user to play the game. It acts as the game controller, has six buttons, each displaying an emoji with a different facial expression, and communicates wirelessly with the android device through Bluetooth. For this purpose, the six facial expressions tested are happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and a neutral/normal, which were implemented in three different game activities: imitation, recognition, and storytelling. The avatars used in the game to represent these facial expressions were first validated through an on-line questionnaire (with 114 answers) with a mean success rate of 96.2%. In order to assess the usability of the game and the playware object, a test was performed with six typically developing children, with 94.4% answer accuracy. At last, the recognition activity was tested with six children with ASD during three/four sessions. Due to the small group test and the short number of sessions, the goal was to test the acceptance of the game rather than the users’ improvement in the activity. It is worth referring that both the serious game and the playware object had a high level of approval from the children and they expressed their interest during the activities. With this preliminary study its intended to contribute to the development of pedagogical resources to be used by professionals and families in the support of children with ASD. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - The current situation of technological innovation in education introduces a new insight into digital games, highlighting their pedagogical value. Considering this panorama, we propose digital game based learning, more specifically with massive multiplayer online games, as a favorable setting to enhance performance by children with ADHD  Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) in order to improve their learning and strengthen their social skills, as well as provide for self-regulation of emotions. To this end, we carried out a case study in the Santa BertillaBoscardín primary school from Medellin city in Colombia, with fourth grade students in the subject of statistics, of whom 17 children were the experimental group and 40 were the control group. The results obtained using a standard test showed there was statistical significance (p-value < 0.005); not only did ADHD students manage to reach the same level of academic performance as control students, but theyalsoachieved slightly higher scores. © 2015, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

AB  - The potential of games in empowering underrepresented groups is a central theme in the field of media studies. However, to ensure that everyone can benefit from them, it is necessary to ensure that they are inclusive and accessible. In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (TDAH) is a neurological problem that involves attention difficulties and deterioration in the student’s academic performance, especially at early ages. The review of the literature made it possible to identify investigations related to serious games aimed at solving the problems generated by ADHD in children in the school stage. However, in general the analyzed works have not considered the integration of psychological, pedagogical and therapeutic aspects that allow the design and construction of a serious game oriented to satisfy the needs of children, therapists, parents, and teachers. For this reason, this research proposes a model for the design of a serious game that allows improving the attention of students who present this problem. As a result it is established that the pedagogical and therapeutic aspects are statistically significant and can be considered by the educational game designers in the analysis and design phase of the product, as well as the incorporation of elements of software engineering and the integration of augmented reality as an emerging technology for the development of a technological tool to support the therapeutic and teachinglearning processes of children. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - The researchers' paper discusses the development of a computer-based educational game which challenges children to interact with the natural environment through physical exploration and experimentation. The researchers' project seeks to counteract the negative behaviours associated with excessive computer game play amongst children 8 to 12 years old. By leveraging the positive learning outcomes that can be achieved through computer gaming and combining these with outdoor learning strategies, Jumping the Fence encourages children to take responsibility for surveying and caring for a local ecosystem. The game requires children to reflect critically on their computer use, become more physically active, gain social skills and develop an affinity towards nature. Educators are able to adapt the game to their school's own curriculum and thereby provide an alternative learning strategy that encourages physical and social engagement.

AB  - Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD or ADD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed mental and behavioral disorders of children. Children with ADHD are characterized by poor attention and distractibility and/or hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. Although there is no "cure" for ADHD, there are accepted treatments that specifically target its symptoms. The most common standard treatments include medication, psychological or behavioral modification, and educational approaches. However, more and more parents began to worry about the side effects of medication. For this reason, this study proposed a new treatment by using digital console games to assist children who suffer from ADD to improve their attention condition. With the advantages of gaming apparatus, this study intends to improve the effect of behavioral intervention and cognitive remediation therapy for ADD children.

AB  - Through the mutual efforts of devoted game researchers and educational practitioners, the value of digital games for learning is starting to augment in formal education, even though considerable opposition persists. Previous studies have shown that an interactive tool tends to educate users better than a pure textual source and it can be argued that in the educational field of perpetual learners such as students with mental retardation, game is a basic form of pedagogy. However, despite the theoretical connection of existing digital game design with accepted general pedagogy methodologies and practices, the important sector of Special Education has not yet been the objective of considerable research. This paper outlines various theories of Special Educational Needs (SEN) pedagogy with a special interest in mental retardation, in order to demonstrate how educational and commercial games are able to embody the fundamental elements of SEN educational methodologies. More precisely, the paper examines how commercial and educational games support various SEN methodologies and theories regarding mental retardation pedagogy such as those described by Christakis (2002), Kalantzis (1985) and Soulis (2002). The theoretical discussion of the paper is further substantiated by some preliminary experimental observations in order to highlight actual correlations between digital game play and learning outcomes. Based on the above theoretical correlations and early findings from pilot observations it can be postulated that serious games constitute an important medium of educational pedagogy for children with learning disabilities due to mental retardation.

AB  - This small-scale qualitative study aimed to explore learning programming through online experiences among middle school students in a school for girls in Saudi Arabia. The low uptake of computing by girls has been a persistent problem in schools and beyond. In Saudi Arabia, there are similar issues in encouraging learners and girls in particular to be interested in computer coding. To explore how to engage learners in coding, an informal online course on programming for learners (age 12) was designed using a community-of-inquiry approach and a gamification process enabled through the use of Thunkable™ and TalentLMS™ to engage learners. An inductive qualitative research approach was used to explore influencing factors for engaging learners in programming. The data comprised three individual interviews, one focus group, a teacher’s diary, and a content analysis of the activities recorded in the TalentLMS™ system’s student progress reports. Findings highlighted the need to consider digital learning agency in the online learning environment and that learning programming online was best facilitated through student collaboration using live tools with teacher support to develop the online community. Further, findings revealed the rationale for the girls enrolling in the online programming course, which included improving their online learning skills, planning future careers, and developing résumés. These findings may contribute to offering some insight into pedagogy that can encourage greater interest in computer programming in schools. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Yearly in Mauritius, only a few Special Educational Needs (SEN) and especially Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students manage to get a passing mark in French language at elementary level. As at date, literature suggests that there is hardly any French language learning tools connected with pedagogical knowledge and technological tools suitable for those children. The rationale behind this paper is to show how gamification of French learning resources can positively affect SEN and especially DHH students’ understanding and level of achievement in the language. Research questions were posed about the difficulties faced when students of that specific group learn to read and write in French, about how the gamification of textual resources can be used to improve the students’ learning, and the impact the games have on the students. The aim of this research is to embed gamification in the teaching and learning process of French language. Advocating for both qualitative and quantitative methods, the project based itself on the pragmatic paradigm while the theoretical framework is based on action research. Using my methodological inventiveness, data was gathered using techniques such as surveys, interviews, observations and focus group discussions through the lenses of narrative inquiry. On average, most students already did quite well when subjected to their teachers’ teaching methods only and showed a slight improvement for some students when games were added as learning aid. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that compromises the quality of social interaction and communication. According to the WHO, there is an estimate that one in every 160 children in the world has the ASD. Early treatment and education of children with ASD are essential. Therefore, the objective of this research was to describe the development process of an educational platform related to autism, which aims to support the experience, communication, and behavior of these children. Methods: To develop, a study of the best practices of Software Engineering and concepts of Serious Game (SG) for the definition of the process was carried out, including Treatment and Education for Autistic and Children with Communication-related Deficits (TEACCH), Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), Music Therapy and Psychomotricity. A Game Engine was also chosen due to the possibility of compiling the application for different operating systems. To verify the requirements, consulting the opinion of experts on the technical and pedagogical requirements was done in accordance with their expertise, including usability applying SUS (System Usability Scale). Results: PERA (in Portuguese, acronym for “Plataforma Educacional Relacionada ao Autismo”) consists of eight modules with speech synthesizer, music, sounds and animation features. The experts’ opinion resulted in the SUS score of 86.9 ± 12.2, considered excellent, according to Brooke’s adjectives. Conclusion: According to experts’ opinion, the educational platform developed includes important requirements in accordance with their specialties and may contribute to the teaching and learning process of children with ASD. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to define the expanding role of technological innovation in TESOL methodology. Development of new educational technologies allows for the greater transformative impact of education in its application to the person-oriented paradigm. In application for TESOL purposes, these new technologized approaches combine self-learning with intercultural connectivity. These conclusions are demonstrated by two digitally-based projects which instantiate TESOL pedagogical techniques with new learning technologies; these allow for interactivity in the learning process with live communication situations, and multi-media expression of culturally authentic materials. The two projects, a video game and digital photo storytelling experience for teaching English to Russian learners, also demonstrate the use of educational technology for targeting special needs English learners, specifically for the blind and visually impaired. © IMSCI 2020.All right reserved.

N1  - Funding text 1: Exhibit 1: The Video Game Project, “US-Russia Cultural Dialogue.” This digital instructional program takes the form of an interactive video game which allows English language learners exposure to colloquial and formal registers of American English in a variety of culturally-relevant contexts. The video game was designed during a year-long grant project sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s U.S.-Russia Peer-to-Peer Dialogue Program. The project was titled, “Getting Closer: A Cross-Cultural U.S.-Russian Project Focusing on Teaching Foreign Languages to U.S. students and Blind/Visually Impaired Students in Russia.” This video game allowed students at the University of Central Florida to bring immersive experience in English language and American culture with them as they traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia, where it was presented for EFL use at a school for the blind and visually impaired. It is predicted that the video game will be viewed as a useful and innovative tool for EFL classrooms in blind and visually impaired schools and elsewhere in Russia, as it achieves exposure to written and spoken American English conducted by native speakers. This includes exposure to variant forms of regional colloquial English, as well as light exposure to the presence of Spanish language as an important reminder of American cultural diversity.

AB  - Assessment at preschool age plays a crucial role in the process of learning especially for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), whom encounter communication difficulties as exchanging thoughts or information by speech, writing or nonverbal expression. Therefore, a well-designed assessment method is necessary in order to guide learning and serve as a powerful tool to reinforce children's motivation to learn. Information about what a child with ASD knows, understands and is able to do is used by tutors to adjust their teaching strategies. All assessment methods have different purposes before, during or after instruction. Besides, formative assessment is the most recommended type that helps improving children's learning and it takes place during the learning process. Also, serious games provide a context for assessing a broader range of skills and constructs compared to traditional assessment approaches. In this article, we propose a new technique for evaluating the degree of concept's assimilation of children with ASD through serious games. It allows identifying concepts that children are struggling to understand and skills they are having difficulty acquiring. © 2020, Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - In the context of special education, teachers may understand that flexibility and variety of teaching strategies are the keys to an effective learning. In many cases, it is necessary to explore different ways to create pluralistic opportunities for students to develop specific skills. In the case of students with dyslexia, it is essential to focus on strategies that help them to get involved in diversified activities and engaged in reading practices, for successful learning. Nevertheless, in the current variety of available activities, there are few standard models’ strategies for dyslexic students; in this scenario, it is important to focus on collaborative and individual educational practices that teachers can use to create appropriate learning contexts, namely the ones that appeal to pedagogical strategies for learners’ motivation and engagement. Using design thinking and gamification can be an effective path in this domain. It is under this scenario that this study aims at understanding the role of design thinking and gamification in supporting the creation of new learning experiences for students with reading and writing disabilities. A new gamified solution was created using the design thinking method as a tool to understand participants’ needs and difficulties, define the problem, ideate to choose the better solution and create prototypes to test and evaluate. Besides reporting on this process, this paper presents the paper-based prototype as an output and discusses the meaningful educational contributions of the whole iterative process of design thinking to the creation of a gamified learning experience. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the development of concepts in children with and without disabilities through digital game creation activities. The study presents the use of technology in a pedagogical approach based on Vygotsky’s theories related to conceptual elaboration, imagination, and creativity in childhood and on advanced studies in game design with children. The qualitative research adopted the Design-Based Research (DBR) as a methodological approach, which made the collaborative and collective performance of students in games creation activities possible. The interdisciplinary team was composed by researchers and undergraduate students in the areas of computing, education, and design and by four children from the third year of Elementary Education at a school in Itajaí, Santa Catarina, including two with intellectual disabilities. Data analysis revealed the children’s appropriation of concepts about digital games and their components, the perception of the game creation process, the complexity inherent in the construction of technologies, and the critical view of children regarding games and their use. Intellectual differences among children were overcome through approaches that favored their different competencies, which afforded admiration among peers, mutual respect, and school inclusion. © 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

AB  - This article presents a study on the impact of a Serious Game (SG), developed to strengthen learning in children in the area of mathematics. The methodology used was based on three phases: in the first, an exploratory research was conducted through surveys and unstructured interviews with authorities and teachers from two educational centers in Tungurahua (Ecuador). In the second, the SG was developed, applying an adaptive algorithm in its architecture, so that it is always entertaining and challenging. Finally, in the third, a quasi-experimental study was carried out in which 50 children of school age participated, of which 50% suffer from mild intellectual disability. The quantitative results showed significant statistical differences in achievement levels, with an increase of 29.5%. A qualitative analysis allowed to collect events and comments from teachers, who stated that the SG constitutes a potential tool to develop learning strategies. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - Special education is a specialized area of education which uses unique instructional methods, materials, learning aids, and equipment to meet the educational needs of students with learning disabilities. Exceptional learner is an inclusive term that refers to students with learning and behavior problems, students with physical disabilities or sensory impairments, and students who are intellectually gifted or have a special talent. Computer games are increasingly part of the daily activities of students of all ages, and have been shown to support student motivation and learning however can be challenging to implement in the classroom. Gamification involves incorporating elements of computer games such as points, leaderboards, and badges into non-game contexts in order to take advantage of the motivation provided by a game environment. Based from literature analysis points, badges and achievements, leaderboards and levels are the most commonly implemented form of gamification.A study was conducted to determine to what extent gamification supports student achievement and motivation among exceptional learners. Incorporating gamification elements into exceptional learners' environments can motivate students and support student achievement. Increased class attendance and participation, which is positively correlated with improved student performance, was seen as a result of gamification. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This article reflects upon the design process of the game Tella, an application for tablet computers, designed for children with special needs in the lowest grades at school. The game facilitates learning of mathematics through playing and exploring. The tablet allows the visual and interaction design to work together with sound and movement, in ways that differs from traditional learning material and classroom practices, supplementing both these arenas of learning. Several different pedagogical principles are applied in the game. This article will focus on the concept of implicit memory/priming: Elements (e.g. the number line) are introduced visually at an early stage, but not put into practical use until later in the game. Priming is a concept from the field of memory research, not a pedagogical principle or a learning theory as such, but in connection with designing games this concept is applicable and very helpful. Further on this article reflects upon the balance between game logic and learning logic, when designing serious games. There are contradictions that need to be negotiated if an application should serve as an e-learning resource as well as an enjoyable game. The article suggests a way of developing educational games. The design of the game started by having experienced teachers sit down and work with designers and game programmers. The result incorporate theories and principles of learning, memory, game design and instructional design.

AB  - Teaching occupational therapy intervention with sexual expression issues in the physically disabled population can be a challenging matter. Students are often uncomfortable with the subject matter, and this deters asking questions and becoming involved in the content to the extent of understanding the subject. Standard classroom approaches can be an ineffective match for teaching subjects requiring self-examination of attitudes. Rather than utilizing standard lecture or audiovisual techniques to engage students in knowledge transfer, this article describes an innovative game designed to help students explore their views on sexuality and learn about issues related to sexual expression for persons with physical disabilities. The rationale for such an activity is presented, as well as an overview of the game, rules, and procedures. Sample game items are included to give the reader a clearer idea of the game's content and focus. Student responses to the game are included. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Collaborative creativity is an essential skill for unleashing university students’ skills in team building during complex problem-solving. The aim of this descriptive quantitative research was to examine undergraduate students’ perspectives regarding their collaborative creativity experience as game creators for a gamification group assignment within a university-wide elective course on learning disabilities. The Assessment Scale of Creative Collaboration (ASCC) questionnaire was completed by 14 students. The results provide insightful perspectives by undergraduate students regarding their experience in collaborative creativity during game creation. The findings from the closed-ended questions of the ASCC demonstrate that most of the students valued the diversity of knowledge and skills of their team members, shared different ideas, adapted their ideas and practices according to the project difficulties, trusted their team members, co-constructed the game together, overcame conflicts in positive ways, developed multiple versions of their game, and coordinated well for their team project. Data from the open-ended questions of the ASCC, which provided detailed but nuanced perspectives of the students, were analysed thematically. Three main themes were identified: the positive aspects of gamification, the constraints related to the gamification project, and teamwork and collaborative problem-solving approaches. This study provides evidence on the feasibility of game creation that is embedded within gamification group projects for fostering collaborative creativity among undergraduate students. Gamification has the potential in supporting the acquisition of 21st century learning and innovation skills in higher education. Implications of the application of gamification in higher education are discussed. Practitioner Notes 1. This study provides preliminary evidence on the feasibility of making game creation accessible to students. This study also supports educators wishing to embed gamification and game creation by students in the course assessment. 2. The undergraduate students reported positive responses about their game creation experience during the gamification project. However, teamwork could be an issue to be addressed more proactively. In this study, one of the students reported that bad teamwork had affected her gamification project although she felt the gamification was a good pedagogical approach. Thus, facilitators should provide the necessary guidelines on effective collaboration, communication, and teamwork approaches to students early in the semester. 3. Most of the students reported that time limitation was a factor in game creation. None of them had expected that an elective course would be so demanding on their time. A possible reason for the lack of time is the unfamiliarity of students with game creation. Given the promising value of gamification and game creation, we suggest that at the macro level, the university elective course committee could identify how innovative pedagogical approaches could be aligned. Specifically, gamification and game creation could be used more widely across university-wide elective courses to reduce the learning curve involved. At the micro level, instructional videos on gamification and game creation may ease the process of learning about the concept and implementation of gamification and game creation. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

N1  - Funding text 1: The gamification project in this course, which was funded by the university’s Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) grant, was intended to enhance active learning, student engagement, meaningful learning, and knowledge acquisition and application of the concepts on LDs among undergraduate students. Gamification was embedded into the course as a student-developed game-design group project.
N1  - Funding text 2: The benefit of game creation is that it naturally encourages students to work together and be creative, allowing them to finish a good quality game in the allotted amount of time. From the beginning of the game's conception until the end, it was supported by the ongoing direction of the course instructors and a lecturer who acted as a gamification coach. The other strength of gamification in this study was that the games were content driven; specifically, the students, as game creators, had identified a narrow content area (e.g., law related to people with disabilities) to be converted into a game. The content-driven game enabled the group to engage more with the course materials and conduct the necessary research about the topic. These games could be made accessible to future cohorts who could play with the games and improve the game mechanics and content covered by the previous cohort. Finally, all innovative teaching and learning do incur some costs. The allocation of funds for the gamification project provided the students with opportunities to collaborate meaningfully toward a product. In turn, the game creation opportunity provided the students with a platform to be exposed to creative collaboration skills that are crucial in future workplaces.

AB  - The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as supporting tools in inclusive education for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been widely discussed. However, a subject lacking in research is contrasting the difficulties that these children experience during their schooling, linked to the use of ICT resources within the educational system in developing economies. This study analyses the existing implications of including children with ASD in a comprehensive educational plan supported by ICT. Following a mixed qualitative-quantitative method, a triangulated analysis is carried out, beginning with a systematic review of the literature, followed by interviews and surveys of teachers and parents involved. The results reveal psychosocial aspects and limitations of children with ASD within pedagogical environments, determining the relevance of ICT use in more inclusive digital education environments. © 2022, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - The paper presents the design of a highly customizable game for children with autism spectrum disorder facing learning difficulties. The same solution can be used for children with or without other developmental disorders facing learning difficulties. The scope of the research was to create a generic solution to facilitate the learning process of reading in the targeted population. The latest pedagogical approaches (TEACCH, PECS, ABA, Makaton, etc.) are combined with appropriate gamification techniques to produce the desired outcome. The game has been developed with the unity game engine in order to run in any device. The final solution has been pilot tested in a small group of highly-functioning children with autism. The results of the design process and the early findings from the pilot testing are presented in the current paper. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - Effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, autonomy, engagement, flexibility, adaptiveness, personalization, conversationality, reflectiveness, innovation, and self-organization are some of the fundamental features of smart environments. Smart environments are considered a good learning practice for formal and informal education; however, it is important to point out the pedagogical approaches on which they are based. Smart learning environments (SLEs) underline the flexibility of eclectic pedagogy that places students at the center of any educational process and takes into account the diversity in classrooms. Thus, SLEs incorporate pedagogical principles derived from (1) traditional learning theories, e.g., behaviorism and constructivism, (2) contemporary pedagogical philosophy, e.g., differentiated teaching and universal design for learning, (3) theories that provide specific instructions for educational design, e.g., cognitive theory of multimedia learning and gamification of learning. The innovative concept of transmedia learning is an eclectic pedagogical approach, which in addition to learning principles, blends all available media so far. WUIM is a transmedia program for training independent living skills aimed primarily at children with learning disabilities, which emerged from the composition of pedagogical theories, traditional educational materials and cutting-edge technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, and art-based production methodologies. This paper outlines the development of WUIM, from the prototyping presented at the 4th International Conference in Creative Writing (2019) to the Alpha and Beta stages, including user and expert evaluations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Chess is a zero-sum game with no uncertainty for any players, as there is no hidden information. The turn-based nature of the game introduces the gaming opportunity as profound in the characteristic of the player's style. Chess players realise and internalise such a body of knowledge, evaluations and further refine the learning from stimulating dialogues that nurture the progressive thinking from shared experience in gaming. Whilst, professional and experts in chess at the highest level have these traits, children and amateurs take a more random approach and enjoy the discoveries in Chess. In this paper, we explore the immersive social space of a playing environment and quantify Individual learning experiences and realise the Chess Board as an Interface to the opponent (who Constraints the Thinking). Further, the gaming opportunity with chess is then reduced to discovering the opponent in the context of effectively engaging in a progressive dialogue (from constrained to the regulated environment). In this formulation, we bring four different accounts of a facilitator's experience to bring an understanding of the journeys of children and young people learning chess. We outline the contrasting ideas and observation from (a) Social Inclusion Perspective with working with children with ADHD in Spain (b) Gender-based Dialogues - understanding female participation in Chess (c) Children's communication in highly Informal, teacherless, teaching less and Self-organised Learning Environment in Wales (d) Reflections from formal Chess-in-school programme in Gibraltar. With various attempts to engage chess in schools and communities, we could now design and nurture dialogic thinking in the context of game-based learning to re-imagine perspectives on how effortlessly (a) Experience is delivered to an audience of a universal appeal (b) Derive useful lessons learned to bring measurable and evidence-based outcomes through Game-based Learning. © The Authors, 2021.

AB  - This article has the purpose of evaluating the process of collaborative construction of a digital game by children with and without disabilities in the context of regular education. It is an applied and qualitative research, whose theoretical-methodological references are based on Vygotsky’s historical-cultural approach to the creative activity of students with intellectual disabilities, in Design-Based Research (DBR), which combines research in education with the problems experienced in practice through collaboration between participants and researchers and in the framework of creating digital games for children. Twenty-five children participated in the research, including three with intellectual disabilities, from the 4th grade of Elementary School in a municipal school in Brazil. Interdisciplinary research combines Education, Design and Computer Science in a creative process that uses pedagogical techniques and game design and the sharing of ideas and collaboration between Elementary School children, with and without disabilities, and Higher Education academics. As a result, the creation of a digital game of authorship and collective idealization of the students was obtained, in the definition of characters, scenarios, mechanics and narratives. Such results confer the protagonism of children in the creation process, the learning of children with disabilities, the integration between academy and school and the feasibility of applying the framework in contexts of regular and inclusive education. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

AB  - In this study, we review existing free digital games for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We examine their features, aim, educational design, and learning theories that underlie them. Fourteen games were analysed. Based on our analysis, behaviourism seems to be a dominant educational approach for the design of games for ASD, despite the educational advantages of constructivist approaches. Through this review, we link the educational design of digital games for children with ASD to the potential learning outcomes, and we provide some insights for game developers, ASD specialists, and teachers, relevant to the design of more effective games for children with ASD. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The paper presents the design of a highly customizable game for children with autism spectrum disorder facing learning difficulties. The same solution can be used for children with or without other developmental disorders facing learning difficulties. The scope of the research was to create a generic solution to facilitate the learning process of reading in the targeted population. The latest pedagogical approaches (TEACCH, PECS, ABA, Makaton, etc.) are combined with appropriate gamification techniques to produce the desired outcome. The game has been developed with the unity game engine in order to run in any device. The final solution has been pilot tested in a small group of highly-functioning children with autism. The results of the design process and the early findings from the pilot testing are presented in the current paper. © 2020, IGI Global.

AB  - The term “edutainment” is formed from two English words: “entertainment” and “education” and combines entertainment and learning. Edutainment is a special education technology, viewed as a complex of modern technical and didactic means of teaching, based on the concept of learning through entertainment. The principle difference between edutainment and the modern paradigm of learning is that the subject is actively involved in the educational process. Edutainment technology tasks have to meet three pedagogical principles: the principle of theory with practice linking, the principle of consistency and the principle of accessibility. Edutainment technology has great potential in the organization of the learning process at the university. It is necessary to maintain a reasonable balance between education and entertainment. Tasks created to promote the interest, need to be balanced with activities to improve intelligence. The main task of edutainment in the university education process is to ensure the enjoyment of the student in the learning process, which can be expressed through interesting content of the material; satisfaction from the independent decision of any task; social interaction with other students; progress in learning; motivating, representing the meaning for a student of material related to the practical aspects of his life. Various edutainment tools were considered – interactive reading, case-study, WebQuests. The author presents the experimental work using Treasure Hunt method as the basis for game-based learning. The results of the study show that edutainment technology contributes to the formation of certain personal and professional qualities of students (tolerance, communication skills, and ability to overcome the psychological barrier when communicating in a foreign language) by the presence of personal meaning in the study of the subject. © 2018 Perspektivy Nauki i Obrazovania.

AB  - Down's syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability worldwide, with language being one of the most affected area. Language skills and literacy acquisition thus require special care. It is still rare to use software to support such care while, simultaneously, providing education and entertainment. This paper presents results of research on the design of gamified software applications to support pedagogical processes of literacy and language acquisition, making them fun, motivating and effective for children with DS. The paper analyses rankings of design domains of gamified e-learning applications done earlier in the research according to pedagogical benefits in entertaining education of DS children. The paper is believed to offer contributions to requirements engineering of e-learning, gamified software applications in general and to computer-assisted education of DS children in particular. The paper directly contributes to the concretization of article 24 (access to Education) of the General Principles, Accessibility, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Usage of applications that implement most beneficial requirements may also indirectly contribute to UNCRPD article 19 -Living independently and being included in the community; article 21 - access to Information and communication services; and, article 27 - Work and employment.

AB  - The needs of special education populations require specific support to scaffold learning. The design and use of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) has the potential to meet these needs. Difficulty in the development of these systems lies in their validation due to the ethics associated in studying learners from this population as well as the difficulty associated with accessing members of this learner group. This paper explores the use of simulated learners as a potential avenue for validating ITS designed for a special education population. The needs of special education learners are discussed. Potential avenues for employing simulated learners and simulated learning environments to test ITS, instructional materials, and instructional methods are presented. Lastly, the expansion of an educational game designed to develop emotion recognition skills in children with autism spectrum disorder is used to illustrate how simulated learning environments can be used to support the learning of these students.

AB  - Teaching occupational therapy intervention with sexual expression issues in the physically disabled population can be a challenging matter. Students are often uncomfortable with the subject matter, and this deters asking questions and becoming involved in the content to the extent of understanding the subject. Standard classroom approaches can be an ineffective match for teaching subjects requiring self-examination of attitudes. Rather than utilizing standard lecture or audiovisual techniques to engage students in knowledge transfer, this article describes an innovative game designed to help students explore their views on sexuality and learn about issues related to sexual expression for persons with physical disabilities. The rationale for such an activity is presented, as well as an overview of the game, rules, and procedures. Sample game items are included to give the reader a clearer idea of the game's content and focus. Student responses to the game are included. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.
